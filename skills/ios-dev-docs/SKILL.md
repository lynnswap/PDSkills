# iOS Dev Docs

## Overview

Use the bundled Xcode IDEIntelligenceChat AdditionalDocumentation to answer iOS development questions.

## Workflow

- Pick the most relevant topic folder under `references` first.
- Search only that folder with `rg` for relevant keywords and API names.
- Open the most relevant files and extract the exact sections needed.
- Prefer quoting or paraphrasing only the documented behavior; avoid speculation.
- Cite the file path in the response when using the docs.

## Topics (folder map)

- SwiftUI: `references/SwiftUI`
- UIKit: `references/UIKit`
- AppKit: `references/AppKit`
- StoreKit: `references/StoreKit`
- MapKit: `references/MapKit`
- AppIntents: `references/AppIntents`
- WidgetKit: `references/WidgetKit`
- visionOS: `references/visionOS`
- Swift: `references/Swift`
- Swift Charts: `references/SwiftCharts`
- SwiftData: `references/SwiftData`
- Foundation: `references/Foundation`
- Foundation Models: `references/FoundationModels`
- Accessibility: `references/Accessibility`
- Visual Intelligence: `references/VisualIntelligence`

## Tips

- Read the smallest relevant file first when multiple matches appear.
- Keep context small by loading only the needed file(s) from the chosen topic folder.
